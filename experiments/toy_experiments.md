# MCW Toy Experiments

These experiments are designed to test coordination dynamics rather than intelligence or correctness.

They are:
- low-cost
- repeatable
- domain-agnostic
- suitable for human–human and human–AI interaction

Each experiment includes:
- hypothesis
- expected MCW failure mode
- graded outcome interpretation

See main discussion for rationale.
