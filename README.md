# Meta-Context Window (MCW) Framework

This repository contains early artifacts for the Meta-Context Window (MCW) framework:  
a coordination-focused lens for understanding human–AI interaction through information exchange rather than model capability.

## Core Idea

AI failures in collaborative settings are often misattributed to intelligence, hallucination, or alignment issues.

MCW proposes that many such failures are better explained as:
- coordination breakdowns
- information loss or distortion
- delayed or suppressed repair

MCW models interaction as the exchange of **Information Units (IUs)** between actors operating under constrained context windows.

## What This Repo Is

- A **methods sandbox**
- A **set of testable artifacts**
- A **shared language** for diagnosing interaction breakdowns
- A **starting point**, not a finished theory

## What This Repo Is Not

- A claim about AI consciousness or sentience
- A replacement for existing alignment or safety work
- A universal theory of intelligence
- A finalized academic framework

## Contents

- `/prompts/`  
  MCW-aware system prompt templates designed as initialization aids, not control mechanisms.

- `/experiments/`  
  Toy experiments for testing MCW claims using low-tech, falsifiable setups.

- `/notes/`  
  Working notes and optional archival material (may be private).

## Status

Early-stage. Exploratory. Intentionally minimal.

Feedback, critique, and falsification are welcome.
